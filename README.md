# resumegen
I was tired of having to edit the html for my resume, so I decided to do that thing that people do where they seperate model from view.

Now, you put the resume data in a json blob and let the ugli javascript make it all pretty!

I'm no expert on this stuff, so the formatting's probably a bit wonky with some sorts of input, but I put an example here that should show of most of what it does.
